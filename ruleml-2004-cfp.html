<H3>Program and Proceedings: </H3>
You are invited to participate in this event: <A href="RuleML2004-program.pdf">PRELIMINARY PROGRAM</A>.
Proceedings will be published
by Springer in the LNCS series, volume number 3323 (<A 
href="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/index.html">www.springer.de/comp/lncs/index.html</A>).


<H3>Workshop Description: </H3>The Semantic Web is a major world-wide endeavour to advance the Web by 
enriching its content with semantic meta-information that can be 
processed by inference-enabled Web applications. Ontologies and automated
reasoning are key techniques in the semantic web initiative. <p>

Rules are considered to be a major issue in the further development of
the semantic web. On one hand, they can be used in ontology languages,
either in conjunction with or as an alternative to description logics. 
And on the other hand, they will act as a means to draw inferences, to 
express constraints, to specify policies, to react to events/changes, 
to transform data, etc. <p>

Finally, rule markup languages will allow to enrich web 
ontologies by adding definitions of derived concepts, to publish rules 
on the Web, to exchange rules between different systems and tools, etc. 
 
<P>The workshop builds on the success of the first workshop RuleML2002 (<A 
href="http://www.ceur-ws.org/Vol-60/">http://www.ceur-ws.org/Vol-60/</A>) held 
in conjunction with ISWC2002 on Sardinia, Italy, and the second workshop held in
conjunction with ISWC2003 on Sanibel Island, USA
(<A href="http://tmitwww.tm.tue.nl/staff/gwagner/RuleML-2003.html">
http://tmitwww.tm.tue.nl/staff/gwagner/RuleML-2003.html</A>).
This year's workshop combines that tradition, in the sense of being the premier RuleML-2004 event, with casting as wide a net as possible regarding all kinds of Rules and Rule Markup Languages for the Semantic Web.
 
<H3>Topics of Interest: </H3>We encourage submissions on all topics related to 
rules and rule mark-up lanugages for the Semantic Web. In particular, the 
workshop seeks papers addressing syntax and semantics of rule languages, 
execution engines, implemented systems, and applications. Specifically:
<UL>
  <LI> language standards (RuleML, SWRL, Jess, N3, F-logic/FLORA-2, etc.) 
  <LI> execution models, engines, and environments 
  <LI> reaction rules for the Semantic Web 
  <LI> event/action languages 
  <LI> defeasible rules for the Semantic Web 
  <LI> defeasible concept definitions in ontologies 
  <LI> resolving conflicts in triggered action sets 
  <LI> implemented tools and systems for rules on the Semantic Web 
  <LI> combining rules and ontologies, integrating rules and description logics 
  <LI> multiple language rules (Prolog, KIF, SQL, OCL, XML, RDF, etc.) 
  <LI> applications based on RDF, ontologies, and rules (including
  e-Services, e-Learning, e-Commerce, Knowledge Management, Bioinformatics)
  <LI> modelling of business rules on the Web
  <LI> rule-based software agents and the Semantic Web 
  <LI> automated negotiations with rule-based declarative strategies
  <LI> connecting rules to legacy knowledge bases 
  <LI> integrating rule bases and distributed fact bases 
  <LI> handling lineage and reliability of distributed information 
  <LI> XSL transformations of rules 
  <LI>&lt; yourTopic ... &gt; </LI></UL>
<H3>Submission: </H3>We invite articles of no more than 15 pages length formated 
in Springer's <A href="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html">LNCS 
style</A> (www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html) describing original completed 
work, work in progress, or interesting problems or use cases. Submitted papers 
will be fully refereed based on the originality and significance of the ideas 
presented as well as on technical aspects. 
<P>Proceedings will be published
   by Springer in the LNCS series, volume number 3323 (<A 
href="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/index.html">www.springer.de/comp/lncs/index.html</A>). 
A special issue, RULES FOR THE SEMANTIC WEB, of the <A href="http://www.semanticwebjournal.org/">Journal of Web Semantics</A>  
is also planned, providing an opportunity to resubmit selected revised, extended papers.

<P>Submissions should be made electronically, in postscript or, preferably, PDF 
 to both<BR>
 antoniou at ics.forth.gr AND harold.boley at nrc.gc.ca BEFORE OR BY 12 July 2004.</B> </P>

<BR>

<BR>
Rules represent the next step for the Semantic Web.  A number of use cases
for Semantic Web Rules have been formally and informally proposed, including
ontology extension, ontology translation, data expansion, portable axiomatic
semantics, matching, monitoring, and profile and process descriptions for
Semantic Web Services.  This talk will describe each of these use cases,
provide examples, and assess the degree to which each are addressed by the
Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) and other current alternatives.

<BR>
Using rules in conjunction with ontologies is a major challenge for the Semantic Web.
We propose a pragmatic approach for reasoning with ontologies and rules,
based on the Semantic Web standards and tools currently available.
We first achieved an implementation of SWRL,
the emerging OWL/RuleML-combining rule standard, using the Protégé OWL plugin.
We then developed a Protégé plugin, SWRLJessTab,
which enables to compute inferences with the Racer classifier and the Jess inference engine,
in order to reason with rules and ontologies, both represented in OWL. A small example,
including an OWL ontology and a SWRL rule base, shows that all the domain knowledge,
i.e. the SWRL rule base and the OWL ontology, is required to obtain complete inferences.
It illustrates that some reasoning support must be provided to interoperate between SWRL and OWL,
not only syntactically and semantically, but also inferentially.
